    Title: Synthesis of Hydroxyapatite from Snail Shell using Microwave Technique.
    <br><br>
    Supervisor: Dr. Yongdan Hou Gbologah
    <ul>
        <li>To produce Hydroxyapatite from snail shell using the microwave technique and check the effect of varying 
            microwave time through samples characterization.</li>
        <li>Methodology included burning snail shell through boxed-type electric furnace, grinding and sieving into fine 
            powder through a 300µm sieve.</li>
        <li>Characterization was performed to check the purity of powder and the availability of Calcium Phosphate which 
            typically is the Hydroxyapatite.</li>
        <li>The experiment was performed with microwave times of 10, 15, and 20 and was left in an enclosed test tube 
            for particles to settle before it was distilled.</li>
        <li>The sample was then dried through a laboratory furnace and later grided and sieved once again.
        </li>
        <li>Subsequently, small volumes of each were taken to the lab for characterization.</li>
        <li>The lab resulted suggested that different microwave time has significant effect on the shape of Hydroxyapatite 
            formed with some having an inclusion of OHAP due to higher heating. </li>
        <li>Microwave synthesis of Hydroxyapatite proved an effective mechanism of producing Hydroxyapatite with 
            consideration given to microwave heating times in order to avoid inclusions.
